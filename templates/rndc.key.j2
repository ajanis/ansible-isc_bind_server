# To activate this key, place the following in named.conf, and
# in a separate keyfile on the system or systems from which nsupdate
# will be run:

key "{{ isc_bind_server_rndc_name }}" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "{{ isc_bind_server_rndc_secret }}";
};

# Then, in the "zone" statement for each zone you wish to dynamically
# update, place an "update-policy" statement granting update permission
# to this key.  For example, the following statement grants this key
# permission to update any name within the zone:
#    update-policy {
#            grant {{ isc_bind_server_rndc_name }} zonesub ANY;
#    };

# After the keyfile has been placed, the following command will
# execute nsupdate using this key:
#    nsupdate -k <keyfile>
